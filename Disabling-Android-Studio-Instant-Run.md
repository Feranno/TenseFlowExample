### Introduction
If you are an Android Studio user, one of **the most important steps to take** is to disable Android Studio Instant Run.  Instant Run is a feature that is designed to streamline the development process by reducing the time to apply code changes to your app.  Unfortunately, Instant Run is limited in function and when used with the _FIRST_ Tech Challenge Android Studio project folder, can cause **severe** and **difficult-to-troubleshoot** problems.

Teams who use Android Studio **_must_** disable Instant Run.

### Locating Instant Run Settings
When you first launch Android Studio a Welcome screen should appear.  You can navigate to the Instant Run Settings from this Welcome screen by selecting the "Configure->Settings" from the "Configure" dropdown list in the lower right hand corner of the screen.

On the left hand side of the Settings window, there should be a category called "Build, Execution, Deployment".  Within that category, click on the "Instant Run" subcategory to displaythe Instant Run settings for your Android Studio installation.  By default, Instant Run is enabled when you first install Android Studio.  Uncheck the "Enable Instant Run to hot swap code/resource changes on deploy (default enabled)" and then click on the "OK" button to disable Instant Run.
