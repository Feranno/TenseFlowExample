# Welcome to the FTC Control System Wiki!
This wiki provides information about the _FIRST_ Tech Challenge (FTC) control system.  It is a "living document" and is intended to be a central repository for information on how to configure, program and operate the Android-based, FTC control system.

# About the FIRST Tech Challenge
The _FIRST_ Tech Challenge seeks to inspire youth to become the next generation of STEM leaders and innovators through participation in mentor-guided robotics competition.  Teams who participate in the _FIRST_ Tech Challenge must build a robot that performs a variety of tasks.  The tasks vary from season to season, and the more tasks that a robot can complete, the more points a team will earn. 

A _FIRST_ Tech Challenge match has an _autonomous_ phase and a _driver-controlled_ or _"tele-operated"_ phase.  In the autonomous phase of a match the run operates without any human input or control.  In the driver-controlled phase, the robot can receive input from up to two human drivers.
