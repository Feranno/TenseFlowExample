### Renaming Your Smartphones
You will need to have two FIRST-approved Android smartphones for the control system.  One phone will be used as the Robot Controller, the other will be used as the Driver Station.

By establishing unique names for your phones, you can ensure that your phones will be communicating with each other rather than other teams’ phones at meets and tournaments. The official rules of the FIRST Tech Challenge require that you change the Wi-Fi name of your smartphones to include your team number and “-RC” if the phone is a Robot Controller or “-DS” if it is a Driver Station.  A team can insert an additional dash and a letter (“A”, “B”, “C”, etc.) if the team has more than one set of Android phones.

If, for example, a team has a team number of 9999 and the team has multiple sets of phones, the team might decide to name one phone “9999-C-RC” for the Robot Controller and the other phone “9999-C-DS” for the Driver Station.  The “-C” indicates that these devices belong to the third set of phones for this team.

Note that it will take an estimated 5 minutes per phone to complete this task.

| 7. Select Configure Device from the pop-up menu. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/RenameStep7.jpg" width="175"> |
| 8. Use touch pad to enter new name of device. <br/>If the device will be a Robot Controller, specify<br/>your team number and "-RC".  If the device will be<br/>a Driver Station, specify your team number and "-DS".<br/><br/>You can also set the Wi-Fi Direct inactivity<br/>timeout to "Never disconnect" and then hit the<br/>**SAVE** button to save your changes.<br/><br/>Note that in the screenshot shown to the right,<br/>the team number is “9999”.  The “-C” indicates<br/>that this is from the third pair of smartphones for<br/>this team.  The “-RC” indicates that this phone<br/>will be a Robot Controller. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/RenameStep8.jpg" width="175"> |
| 9. After renaming phone, power cycle the device. | 

### Installing the FTC Apps
The FTC apps are available to download for free from the Google Play store.  You will need to have your Android phones connected to a Wi-Fi network that has Internet access before you can access the Google Play store.  You will also need a Google account to be able to download the apps from the Google Play store.

It is also possible to "side-load" the FTC Android Apps onto the Robot Controller and Driver Station phones.  The GitHub repository contains the release versions of the Android apps:

https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/tree/master/doc/apk

However, this section of the wiki does **not** include instructions on how to side-load the apps.  It only explains how to use Google Play to install the FTC apps.

Note that it will take an estimated 7.5 minutes per phone to complete this task.

| ----------- | :---: |
| 1. From the Android Wi-Fi screen look for the name of <br/>your wireless network (“CE_NET” in this example) and <br/>touch the wireless network name to login to the network.  | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/InstallStep1.jpg" width="175"> |
| 2. Specify the password using the touch keypad and hit <br/>CONNECT to connect to this wireless network. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/InstallStep2.jpg" width="175"> |
| 3. Find the Google Play Store icon on your phone and <br/>click it to launch the Google Play Store app. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/InstallStep3.jpg" width="175"> |
| 4. If you haven’t signed into your Google account yet, <br/>follow the onscreen instructions to log into your <br/>Google account. <br/><br/>If you don’t have a Google account, follow the onscreen <br/>instructions create a new account. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/InstallStep4.jpg" width="175"> |
| 5. In the search window of the Google Play app, <br/>type in the words “FTC Robot Controller” to find the <br/>Robot Controller or “FTC Driver Station” to find the <br/>appropriate FTC app for your phone. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/InstallStep5.jpg" width="175"> |
| 6. Tap on the app in the Google Play listing to bring <br/>up the installation screen.  Follow the onscreen <br/>instructions to install the appropriate app for your phone.<br/><br/>**Important note:** When you install the FTC apps, **_only install <br/>one FTC app_** (FTC Robot Controller or FTC Driver Station) **_per <br/>phone._**<br/><br/>You should avoid installing both apps onto the same phone. <br/>Doing so can cause Wi-Fi connection problems.  You should <br/>only install the FTC Robot Controller app onto the phone <br/>that will be the Robot Controller and the FTC Driver Station <br/>app onto the phone that will be the Driver Station. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/InstallStep6.jpg" width="175"> |
| 7. After you have successfully installed the app, you should<br/>forget the external wireless network on your phone.<br/><br/>Go to the Android Wi-Fi screen, find the name of the <br/>currently connected network, and tap on the network name <br/>to bring up a pop-up box with info about the network. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/InstallStep7.jpg" width="175"> |
| 8. Click on the **FORGET** button to forget the wireless network. | <img src="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/WikiSupport/blob/master/ftc_app/images/InstallStep8.jpg" width="175"> |
