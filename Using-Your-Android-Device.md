Before you get started with your control system, it is helpful if you familiarize yourself with the basic operation of your Android device.  

### Unlocking Your Screen
When you first power on an Android phone, it usually starts off with the screen in a "locked" state.  For the Motorola smartphones that are used in the _FIRST_ Tech Challenge, you must touch the locked screen and then slide your finger upwards along the screen to unlock the phone.  Note that different devices might require a slightly different procedure to unlock the screen.

Depending on your security settings, you might be challenged for a pass code or PIN number.  Use the touch screen to enter in the pass code or PIN value and tap on the checkbox symbol to login to the device.

### Navigating in Android

Your phone should display its home screen if you just powered it on and unlocked it.

At the bottom of the screen there should be some buttons that you can use to navigate the screens on your Android device. Note that the screenshots in this section were made using a Motorola Moto G4 Play phone.  If you are using a different Android device, then your screens might differ slightly.

The leftmost button (see image above) is the "Back" button.  You can use this button to return to the previous screen on your Android device.

The center button is the "Home" button.  Pressing this button should take you back to the home or opening screen of your Android device.

The rightmost button is the "Recent Apps" button.  If you click on this button it will display the apps that were recently run and are dormant in the background.  You can close a recent app by tapping the "X" button on the app's listing.

### Using the App Drawer
There is another row of buttons visible above the "Back", "Home" and "Recent Apps" buttons.  In the center of this row of buttons is a button that has an array of dots or squares.

Tapping on this button will launch the _Android App Drawer_.  The App Drawer displays a list of all of the apps that are available on your Android device.  You can scroll through the App Drawer screens to find and launch an app.
