# About the _FIRST_ Tech Challenge
The _FIRST_ Tech Challenge seeks to inspire youth to become the next generation of STEM leaders and innovators through participation in mentor-guided robotics competition.  Teams who participate in the _FIRST_ Tech Challenge must build a robot that performs a variety of tasks.  The tasks vary from season to season, and the more tasks that a robot can complete, the more points a team will earn. 

A _FIRST_ Tech Challenge match has an _autonomous_ phase and a _driver-controlled_ or _"tele-operated"_ phase.  In the autonomous phase of a match the run operates without any human input or control.  In the driver-controlled phase, the robot can receive input from up to two human drivers.
